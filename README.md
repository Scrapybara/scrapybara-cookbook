Example code and guides for building with the [Scrapybara API](https://docs.scrapybara.com). To run these examples, you'll need a Scrapybara account and associated API key ([create a free account here](https://accounts.scrapybara.com/sign-up)). Set an environment variable called `SCRAPYBARA_API_KEY` with your API key.

Code examples are written in Python and TypeScript with the [Act SDK](https://docs.scrapybara.com/act-sdk).

Each example is a self-contained project that can be run locally. To run an example, navigate to its directory and follow its README for specific setup instructions.

## Contributing

The Scrapybara Cookbook is a community-driven resource. Whether you're submitting an idea, fixing a typo, adding a new guide, or improving an existing one, your contributions are greatly appreciated!

Before contributing, read through the existing issues and pull requests to see if someone else is already working on something similar. That way you can avoid duplicating efforts.

If there are examples or guides you'd like to see, feel free to suggest them on the [issues page](https://github.com/scrapybara/scrapybara-cookbook/issues).

If you'd like to create new examples, make sure to read through our [contribution guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md). We welcome high-quality submissions, as long as they meet our criteria and fit within the scope of the cookbook.
