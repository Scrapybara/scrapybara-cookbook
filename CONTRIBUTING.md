## What makes a good contribution?

Generally, we have found that the best contributions to the Cookbook are **useful**, **novel** or **creative**, or a combination of these.

- **Useful:** Involves concepts or techniques that can be applied broadly and often, and can translate to practical use-cases and solving real-world problems. If you're doing something often, chances are others are too, and having reusable examples to reference can be very helpful.
- **Novel:** Showcases new developments or techniques. Look out for new research on how to best use LLMs, or new models and capabilities in the API.
- **Creative:** Uses LLMs in creative and innovative ways, or combines multiple APIs and tools in novel ways.
